# Illustration style presets
ILLUSTRATION_STYLE: str = """
Bold, uniform 2px black outlines around all elements; vibrant, saturated primary and 
secondary colors (royal blue skies #4A90E2, emerald green trees #2D9D78, golden yellow 
meadows #F5D76E); simplified animal shapes with consistent proportions across species; 
all animals rendered with the same level of detail and style (semi-realistic silhouettes 
with 2-3 identifying features); animal faces with consistent expression style (slightly 
enlarged eyes, simplified nose and mouth); consistent fur/texture treatment using solid 
color blocks with 1-2 highlight areas; animals sized proportionally to surroundings 
(maintaining realistic scale relationships); all animals posed in profile or 3/4 view; 
30% stylization with 70% realism balance; consistent morning/evening golden lighting; 
clear depth with 3-4 distinct layers (foreground, middle ground, background); 
water surfaces with simple ripple patterns and clear reflections; 
consistent horizon line placement at upper third of each composition; 
soft, rounded cloud shapes with minimal detail; vegetation rendered in simplified 
clusters rather than individual leaves; crisp shadows with slight blue tint; 
clean negative space to avoid overwhelming young viewers; 
all scenes shown from eye-level perspective at child height.
